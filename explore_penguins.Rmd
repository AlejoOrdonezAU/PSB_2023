## Objectives of the tutorial.

This practical focuses on how to use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA),
with its visualization tools and simple statistics, to: 1) get an
overview of multidimensional ecological data. 2) Get a sense of the
variability in the measured variables. 3) Assess the need of
transforming or re-code some variables. 4) Get a sense of possible
relations between variables.

## About the data.

Data were collected and made available by [Dr. Kristen
Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php)
and the [Palmer Station Antarctica
LTER](https://pallter.marine.rutgers.edu/),a member of the [Long Term
Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/).

The original `palmerpenguins` data contains morphological information on
244 individuals of three penguin species (152 individuals of Adelie
penguins, G68 individuals of Gentoo penguins, and 124 individuals of
Chinstrap penguins).

For this tutorial you will use a simplified version of the data set. For
each individual, the data set provides measurements on location
(`island`), bill length in mm (`bill_length_mm`) bill depth in mm
(`bill_depth_mm`), flipper length in mm (`flipper_length_mm`), body mass
in g (`body_mass_g`), sex (`sex`), and sampling year (`year`).

## First Contact - *What is in the data set?*

We can start our data exploration, by checking what is in the data set.
The data is preloaded as the equality names `penguins` object.

For this, the first step is to check `penguins` type of object using the
function `class()`, and what information type is contained in each
variable using the function `str()`

```{r DataHead}
# print the first six rows of the data set
head(penguins)
# query the structure of the data set
str(penguins)
```

By doing this you can see that the data set has eight (8) columns, with
there factor variables (`species`, `island`, and `sex`), and five (5)
numeric variables (either a double number [`bill_length_mm` or
`bill_depth_mm`] or a integer [`flipper_length_mm`,`body_mass_g`]).
Also, you can see that there are some individuals for which we are
missing some information [e.g., row 4, where you see `NA` as the value
in a cell). As a reminder, for `R`, empty values are represented as `NA`
that means **Not Available**.

Given that there are missing cells, the first question you might ask is:
*for how many individuals I have information for **ALL** variables*. One
way to look at this is to use the `complete.cases()` function, which
return a logical vector indicating which cases are complete.

```{r FullDataset}
# Check if a given row has data for all variables
complete.cases(penguins)

# How many of the rows have data for all variables
sum(complete.cases(penguins))

# What proportion of rows have data for all variables
sum(complete.cases(penguins))/dim(penguins)[1]
```

Removing the rows with at least one variable missing would reduce the
data set from **`r dim(penguins)[1]`**, to
**`r sum(complete.cases(penguins))`** observations.

For the sake of simplicity you will now only use a data set with
complete cases. That requires you to *remove* rows without data, **OR**
*retain* observations with no empty cells. As the `complete.cases()`
function, which return a logical vector indicating which cases are
complete, we can easily take the second approach, and name the
"filtered" data set `penguins.Compt`.

```{r DatasetFilter}
## Filter observations with empty cells. 
penguins.Compt <- penguins[complete.cases(penguins),]

# Print the first six rows of the Filtered data set
head(penguins.Compt)
```

## Explore variables - Sampling effort.

As a start you can look how many individuals for each species were
sampled. One way to do this is to "count" the number of individuals for
each species in your "complete" data set. A easy way to do this is using
the `table()` function which builds a contingency table of the counts at
each combination of factor levels.

```{r Table}
# builds a contingency table of the counts of the variable of interest
table(penguins.Compt$species)
```

Based on this you know that you have
`r table(penguins.Compt$species)[1]` individuals for
`r levels(penguins.Compt$species)[1]` penguins,
`r table(penguins.Compt$species)[2]` individuals for
`r levels(penguins.Compt$species)[2]` penguins, and
`r table(penguins.Compt$species)[3]` individuals for
`r levels(penguins.Compt$species)[3]` penguins.

This Data can also be displayed as a figure. Namely a bar plot where you
have for each species a bar showing how many individuals were sampled.
This can be plotted using the `barplot()` function.

```{r barplot1}
# Plot the counts as a bar plot
barplot(table(penguins.Compt$species),
        las = 1,
        xlab = "penguin species", # Text of the x-axis label
        ylab = "Number of individuals", # Text of the x-axis label
        col = gray(3 : 0 / 3) # colours 
        )
```

But what about the number of individuals per penguin species in the
`r length(unique(penguins.Compt$island))` sampled islands? Lucky, the
the `table()` function allows you to create contingency tables by
groping multiple variables. you only need to define the groping
variables.

```{r Table@D}
# builds a contingency table of the counts of the two variables of interest
table(penguins.Compt$species,
      penguins.Compt$island)
```

Based on this you now can know how many individuals of each species were
sampled in each island (by looking at each column), or how many
individuals of a species were sampled in each island (by looking at each
row). This summary can also be displayed as a bar plot by plotting the
output of the `table()` function using the `barplot()` function.

```{r barplot2a}
# Plot the counts as a bar plot - counting individuals by island 
barplot(table(penguins.Compt$species,
              penguins.Compt$island),
        legend.text = unique(penguins.Compt$species), # The grouping legend
        las = 1,
        xlab = "Island", # Text of the x-axis label
        ylab = "Number of individuals", # Text of the x-axis label
        col = gray(3 : 0 / 3) # colours 
        )
```

Now you try to build the same bar plots as above but do the flowing
changes:

1)  Group the counts of individuals by species (that is, species should
    be in the x-axis).

2)  Include the argument `beside = T`.

```{r barplot2b}
# Plot the counts as a bar plot - counting individuals by species
barplot(table(penguins.Compt$island,
              penguins.Compt$species),
        legend.text = unique(penguins.Compt$island), # The grouping legend
        las = 1,
        xlab = "penguin species", # Text of the x-axis label
        ylab = "Number of individuals", # Text of the x-axis label
        col = gray(3 : 0 / 3), # colours
        beside = T # are bars stacked on-top of each other? 
        )
```

What is the main difference between the two bar-plots? namely that the
second bar plot allows us to compare number of sampled individuals per
island on each species.

With this initial exploration you have a good sense of how the sampling
intensity per species and islands. I would encourage you to now try to
do this data exploration using `sex` as a grouping variable.

## Explore variables - Descriptive statistics.

To start, we need to clarify the difference between **descriptive
statistic** (in the count noun sense) **descriptive statisticS** (in the
mass noun sense). descriptive statistic s a summary statistic that
quantitatively describes or summarizes features from a collection of
information, while descriptive statistics is the process of using and
analysing those statistics. Here we will us the count noun sense
definition.

Descriptive statistics provide simple summaries about the sample and
about the observations that have been made. We usually focus on the
first four [moments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_(mathematics))
of the density distribution of a variable. These include [central
tendency metrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_tendency) (e.g.,
Mean, median Mode),
[dispersion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_dispersion)
(e.g., Standard deviation, Standard error, Interquartile range,
coefficient of variation),
[skewness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness), and
[kurtosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtosis). For simplicity we
will only look at central tendency and dispersion metrics.

In `R` you can get a quick overview of the data by using the `summary()`
function.

```{r summStat}
# Summary of the Dataset
summary(penguins.Compt)
```

Based on this table you have a sense of the over number of observation
per factor level. For numeric variables, you get a sense of the overall
variability (extremes, and quartiles) and the central tendency
([mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean) and
[median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median)).

But what about if you what to check the central tendency and dispersion
metrics for a single class? You could just subset the dataset for only
that class of interest and Ask `R` to give you a summary of the data
using the `summary()` function.

```{r summStatSubset}
# Estimate the Summary for the first level class
summary(penguins.Compt[penguins.Compt$species == "Adelie", ])
# Estimate the Summary for The second level class
summary(penguins.Compt[penguins.Compt$species == "Chinstrap", ])
# Estimate the Summary for the third level class
summary(penguins.Compt[penguins.Compt$species == "Gentoo", ])
```

This give you now an overview of the variability and central tendency
per group.

## Explore variables - Morphological variability.

One of the goals of EDA is describe the variability in the variable of
interest. On simple way to visualize this attribute is to display the
distribution of a variable of interest and compare the distribution of
this variable across groups. Here you will focus on **culmen depth** and
**culmen length** - These are the same as bill depth and length.

![Bill measurements - "Artwork by
@allison_horst".](/Users/alejandroordonez/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Courses_&_Conferences/2023/Courses/ProgrammingAndStatisticsForBiologists/Class/Week%206%20-%20AO/Lecture/Code%20in%20the%20slides/culmen_depth.png)

One way to look at this is using
[histograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram). These can be easy
plotted in`R` using the `hist()` function. As an example we will plot
the distribution of `bill_length_mm` and `bill_depth_mm` side by side.

```{r hist1}
# Define the plot space so that you have two panels side by side.
par(mfcol = c(1,2) #Define that the panels are filled are column-wise
                  # (mfrow means row wise) and you have X-rows , Y-columns
                  # in the plot space
    )
# Plot the Histogram for the first variable
hist(penguins.Compt$bill_length_mm,
     xlab = "Bill length (mm)", # x-axis label 
     main = "Bill length (mm)" # Title
     )
# Plot the Histogram for the first variable
hist(penguins.Compt$bill_depth_mm,
     xlab = "Bill depth (mm)", # x-axis label
     main = "Bill depth (mm)" # Title
     )
```

One thing is clear form this visualization is that we have different
number of bars per variable. You could try to standardize these by
adding the argument `breaks = 5` which tells the function to plot the
distribution using five 5 breakpoints.

```{r hist2}
# Define the plot space so that you have two panels side by side.
par(mfcol = c(1,2) #Define that the panels are filled are column-wise
                  # (mfrow means row wise) and you have X-rows , Y-columns
                  # in the plot space
    )
# Plot the Histogram for the first variable
hist(penguins.Compt$bill_length_mm,
     xlab = "Bill length (mm)", # x-axis label 
     main = "Bill length (mm)", # Title
     breaks = 5 #how many breakpoints to have
     )
# Plot the Histogram for the first variable
hist(penguins.Compt$bill_depth_mm,
     xlab = "Bill depth (mm)", # x-axis label
     main = "Bill depth (mm)", # Title
     breaks = 5 #how many breakpoints to have
     )
```

You could do more to this visualization, like changing the colour of the
bars (using the `col = "red` arguments) or adding a density plot over it
(using the `density()` function.

```{r hist3}
# Plot the Histogram for the variable of interest
hist(penguins.Compt$bill_length_mm,
     xlab = "Bill length (mm)", # x-axis label 
     main = "Bill length (mm)", # Title
     breaks = 5, #how many breakpoints to have
     col= "red", # add a colour
     freq = F# plot the frequencies (T) OR probability densities (F)
     )

# Computes kernel density for the variable of interest 
DenPlto <- density(penguins.Compt$bill_length_mm)
# Plot the kernel density for the variable of interest
polygon(x = DenPlto, # the kernel density object
        lwd = 2, # The width of the plotted line
        lty = 2 # The plotted line type (2 = hashed)
        )
```

One more thing you could add here the distribution central tendency
([mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean) and
[median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median)) and [95% confidence
intervals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval) (which can
be approximated as 2x[standard
deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) around the
mean).

```{r moments}
# Plot the Histogram for the variable of interest
hist(penguins.Compt$bill_length_mm,
     xlab = "Bill length (mm)", # x-axis label 
     main = "Bill length (mm)", # Title
     breaks = 5, #how many breakpoints to have
     col= "red", # add a colour
     freq = F# plot the frequencies (T) OR probability densities (F)
     )

# Computes kernel density for the variable of interest 
DenPlto <- density(penguins.Compt$bill_length_mm)
# Plot the kernel density for the variable of interest
polygon(x = DenPlto, # the kernel density object
        lwd = 2, # The width of the plotted line
        lty = 2 # The plotted line type (2 = hashed)
        )

# Estimate the mean
mean.BillLngt <- mean(penguins.Compt$bill_length_mm)
mean.BillLngt
# plot the mean as a vertical solid line 
abline(v = mean.BillLngt,
       lwd = 2, # The width of the plotted line
       lty = 1 # The plotted line type (1 = solid)
       )

# Estimate the median
median.BillLngt <- median(penguins.Compt$bill_length_mm)
median.BillLngt
# plot the median as a vertical solid line 
abline(v = median.BillLngt,
       lwd = 2, # The width of the plotted line
       lty = 3 # The plotted line type (3 = doted)
       )

# Estimate the SD
SD.BillLngt <- sd(penguins.Compt$bill_length_mm)
SD.BillLngt

# plot the median as a vertical hashed-doted line 
abline(v = mean.BillLngt+(2*SD.BillLngt),
       lwd = 2, # The width of the plotted line
       lty = 4 # The plotted line type (4 = hashed-doted)
       )
abline(v = mean.BillLngt-(2*SD.BillLngt),
       lwd = 2, # The width of the plotted line
       lty = 4 # The plotted line type (4 = hashed-doted)
       )
```

While this is a great visualization, it is not clear if `bill_length_mm`
variability is larger or smaller than that of `bill_depth_mm`. One way
to assess this is to use [box
plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot). Box plots provide a
graphical description of the spread and skewness groups of numerical
data through their [quartiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile).
In `R` we can plot these using the `boxplot()` function.

Now we will plot the variability in `bill_length_mm` and `bill_depth_mm`
using box plots.

```{r boxplot1}
# Plot the box plot for two variables
boxplot(penguins.Compt[,c("bill_length_mm","bill_depth_mm")],
        xlab = "variable", # X-label description
        ylab = "measurment (mm)", # Y-label description
        col = c("red","blue")# Set colours for the box plots
        )
```

It is important to know what `R` is plotting in a box plot. As shown
below, box plots show the main
[quartiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile) of a distribution.
By comparing these you comparing the position and size of the boxes you
can get some sense of differences in the mean and variances of a
variable.

![What is is a box plot - from
www.datacamp.com/](/Users/alejandroordonez/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Courses_&_Conferences/2023/Courses/ProgrammingAndStatisticsForBiologists/Class/Week%206%20-%20AO/Lecture/Code%20in%20the%20slides/BoxplotR_Fig.jpg){width="50%"}

One point you might be asking yourselves is "does it make sense to
contrast these two variables. **The answer is of "course not"**.
However, you could compare each of these variable between penguin
species. This can be done using box plots also. However, you will use a
different syntax within the `boxplot()` function. Namely, you will use
the formula interface (i.e. `Y~X`), to create a box plot showing the
distribution of `bill_length_mm` over the different penguins `sepcies`.

```{r boxplot2}
# Plot the box plot for a variables grouped by a factor
boxplot(bill_length_mm~species, # A formula --> Cont.Variable ~ grouping variable
        data = penguins.Compt, # the source data.frame
        xlab = "species", # X-label description
        ylab = "measurment (mm)", # Y-label description
        col = c("red","blue","purple")# Set colours for the box plots
        )

```

Based on this you could say that Adelie penguins have shorter bills than
Gentoo and Chinstrap penguins. Also, you could say that Gentoo and
Chinstrap penguins have similar `bill_length_mm` as their interquartile
ranges overlap.

However, we have another variable that could determine these patterns:
`sex`. We know that males penguins tend to be slightly bigger and have
slightly longer beaks. So assessing differences in `bill_length_mm`
between species could benefit of also including `sex` as a grouping
variable. This is also done using the formula interface (i.e. `Y~X*Z`).

```{r boxplot3}
boxplot(bill_length_mm~species*sex, # A formula --> Cont.Variable ~ grouping variable
        data = penguins.Compt, # the source data.frame
        xlab = "species", # X-label description
        ylab = "measurment (mm)", # Y-label description
        col = c("red","blue","purple")# Set colours for the box plots
        )
```

Based on this new visualization is clear that the Adelie \< Gentoo \<
Chinstrap ranking is consistent even after accounting for sex.

## Explore variables - Morphological correlations.

Lastly, we will evaluate the relation between `bill_length_mm` and
`flipper_length_mm` so see if these species have different
[allometric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allometry) relationships.
Here we will explore if a increase in `bill_length_mm` as a function of
`flipper_length_mm` is similar between species. For this, we need to
make a scatter-plot of `bill_length_mm` and `flipper_length_mm` (BTW,
you usually write Y vs. X).

```{r Scatplt1}
# Plot the changes in Y as a function of X (Y vs X)
plot(bill_length_mm ~ flipper_length_mm, # a Formula indicating the relation to plot
     data = penguins.Compt, # The data frame with the data
     xlab = "flipper length (mm)", # X-axis label.
     ylab = "bill length (mm)", # Y-axis label.
     main = "allometric relationship", # Main title 
     pch = 19 # Type of point to plot (19 = full)
     )
# Define a linear relation 
TrendLine <- line(y = penguins.Compt$bill_length_mm, # Response
                  x = penguins.Compt$flipper_length_mm # predictor
                  ) 
abline(coef(TrendLine), # Regression coefficients 
       lwd = 2 # With of the line
       )
```

Based on this you could say that there is a link between
`bill_length_mm` and `flipper_length_mm`. To assess how strong this link
is, you could estimate the [Pearson correlation
coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient).
In R this can be done using the `cor()` or `cor.test()` functions. The
difference between these is that `cor()` **ONLY** estimates the
coefficient, while `cor.test()` also estimates the "significance" of the
correlation (i.e., if the relation is different form what you would
expect from a random linkage between variables).

```{r CorTest}
# Estimate the correlation between the variables
cor(y = penguins.Compt$bill_length_mm, # Variable 1
    x = penguins.Compt$flipper_length_mm # Variable 2
    )

# Estimate the correlation between the variables and its significance 
cor.test(y = penguins.Compt$bill_length_mm, # Variable 1
         x = penguins.Compt$flipper_length_mm # Variable 2
         )
```

Based on this you could conform that there is a strong link between
`bill_length_mm` and `flipper_length_mm`. But what about our original
question: is the variation between species in the `bill_length_mm` vs
`flipper_length_mm` relation? To test this we can start by plotting
`bill_length_mm` vs `flipper_length_mm` again but colouring the dots by
the corresponding species.

```{r Scatplt2}
# Plot the changes in Y as a function of X (Y vs X)
plot(bill_length_mm ~ flipper_length_mm, # a Formula indicating the relation to plot
     data = penguins.Compt, # The data frame with the data
     xlab = "flipper length (mm)", # X-axis label.
     ylab = "bill length (mm)", # Y-axis label.
     main = "allometric relationship", # Main title 
     pch = 19, # Type of dot to plot (19 = full)
     col = penguins.Compt$species # Colour by species (it works as penguins.Compt$species is a factor)
     )
# add a legend for the colours
legend("bottomright", # location based on a string
       fill= 1:3,
       legend = levels(penguins.Compt$species))

# Plot the  linear relation for all the species
TrendLine <- line(y = penguins.Compt$bill_length_mm, # Response
                  x = penguins.Compt$flipper_length_mm # predictor
                  ) 
abline(coef(TrendLine), # Regression coefficients 
       lwd = 2 # With of the line
       )
```

Base don this plot you could say that the overall relation works for the
Adelie and Gentoo penguins, but not for the Chinstrap penguin. For this
last one there the change in bill length per mm change in flipper length
could be the same, **BUT** it will have a larger Bill than Adelie and
Gentoo penguins that have the same flipper length (because the points
are higher than the overall trend line).

## Final Points.

With this, we have done a preliminary evaluation of the Palmer penguins
data set, getting to know how it sampling intensity, variability in
variables, and relations between these. With this, you can now start
generating informed hypotheses.
